# Parcels 10-year anniversary | Session 4: What is Parcels v4?

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/OceanParcels/10year-anniversary-session4/main)

In this workshop, you will learn how to write `Kernels` in the new v4 style. 

You will be converting some of the Kernels you wrote in [Session 2](https://github.com/OceanParcels/10year-anniversary-session2) to work in Parcels v4. 

If you want, you can also try writing a custom `Interpolator` function with the new API.

If you're interested in trying out Parcels with unstructured grids and the new `UxGrid` class, check out our [FESOM2 unstructured grid tutorial](https://github.com/ELPHE-WW/UXParcels-tutorials)
